## 📂 Projects Included

### 🔹 Basic
- Fundamental networking setups in Packet Tracer.
- Great for beginners getting started with network simulations.

### 🔹 DHCP
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server configuration.
- Automates IP assignment in the network.

### 🔹 DHCP via Router
- Configuring DHCP services directly on a router.
- Demonstrates router-based IP management.

### 🔹 DNS
- Domain Name System (DNS) configuration.
- Shows how hostnames can be resolved to IP addresses in a network.

### 🔹 Default Routing
- Setting up a default route for network traffic.
- Ensures packets are forwarded when no specific route is available.

### 🔹 Static Routing
- Manual configuration of routing tables.
- Highlights how static paths are set between networks.

### 🔹 VLAN
- Virtual Local Area Network setup.
- Segregates networks logically for better efficiency and security.

### 🔹 Firewall
- Basic firewall configuration in Packet Tracer.
- Controls traffic flow and adds a layer of security.

### 🔹 VPN
- Virtual Private Network configuration.
- Secure communication across different networks.
